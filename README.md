  run_analysis.R is an R script that performs the following steps:
      1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
      3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
      5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and work to clean up the data.

  Tidy_data.txt contains the final data set after going through the process described above.
